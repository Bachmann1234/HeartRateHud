# Heart Rate HUD
## Displays your heart rate on your computer, without getting in the way

![Project in action](/InAction.png?raw=true "League of Legends Screenshot with heart rate displayed")

Project opens up an embedded server so it can recieve requests whose body contains HR data. Designed to be used in companion with the [HR Streamer](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/hr-streamer). The display sits on top of all other running windows but it is semi transparent and mouse events pass though so it wont take focus.
